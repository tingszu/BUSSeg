# Abstract
We present a novel deep network (namely BUSSeg) equipped with both within- and cross-image long-range dependency modeling for automated lesions segmentation from breast ultrasound images, which is a quite daunting task due to (1) the large variation of breast lesions, (2) the ambiguous lesion boundaries, and (3) the existence
of massive speckle noise and artifacts in ultrasound images. Our work is motivated by the fact that most existing methods only focus on modeling the within-image dependencies while neglecting the cross-image dependencies, which are essential for this task under limited training data and massive noise. We first propose a novel crossimage dependency module (CDM) with a cross-image contextual modeling scheme and a cross-image dependency loss (CDL) to capture more consistent feature expression
and alleviate noise interference. Compared with existing cross-image methods, the proposed CDM has two merits. First, we utilize more complete spatial features instead
of commonly used discrete pixel vectors to capture the semantic dependencies between images, mitigating the negative effects of speckle noise and making the acquired
features more representative. Second, the proposed CDM includes both intra- and inter-class contextual modeling rather than just extracting homogeneous contextual dependencies. Furthermore, we develop a parallel bi-encoder architecture (PBA) to tame a Transformer and a convolutional neural network to enhance BUSSegâ€™s capability
in capturing within-image long-range dependencies and hence offer richer features for CDM. We conducted extensive experiments on two representative public breast
ultrasound datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed BUSSeg consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in most metrics.
